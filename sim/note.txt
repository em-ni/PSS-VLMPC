remember I want to the vlm to design the cost function such that is stable, so respecting the conditions in Neural Network-Based Model Predictive Control with Input-to-State Stability.
First for a single constant reference and then extending to a moving reference (trajectory tracking)

I can probably finetune the vlm for predicting the reference trajectory and/or the cost parameters

I can use the vlm to predict the next way point within the region of attraction, until it reaches the final target
