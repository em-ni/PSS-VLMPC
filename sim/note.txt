TODO:
- give more emphasis to the stability, for now it's not checked after the target assignment from the vlm
  for example I can compute the region of attraction given the current: state, ref, Q, R, LAMBDA
  then the vlm can predict the next target inside it (ref) and the next value for the parameters (to be used to recompute the roa at the next step)
- as written in stability_check think of using the dataset to train the NN as a lookup for the terminal cost
  For example take the u_ref corresponding the the x_ref or even approximate the solution of DARE
- write about the optimality gap for the case of NN used both in the mpc and in the DARE
