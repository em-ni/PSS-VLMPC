# Real-Time Neural MPC for a Generic System

This project implements the Real-Time Neural MPC (RTN-MPC) strategy for a generic system whose dynamics are modeled entirely by a neural network. It is a generalized version of the concepts presented in the paper "Real-time Neural MPC: Deep Learning Model Predictive Control for Quadrotors and Agile Robotic Platforms".

The core idea is to locally approximate the neural network dynamics at each time step and use these linear approximations within a fast `acados` optimization framework.

## Prerequisites
Follow the installation guide in the original [repo](https://github.com/TUM-AAS/neural-mpc/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file)

## How to Run Example
Train the NN, then run the MPC

```bash
python  model/train_example.py
python example.py
